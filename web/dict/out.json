results in the elastic properties described above being developed in dough from gluten in it. by hand kneading, or by kneading in an automatic breadmaker, the elasticity develops only to the extent that gluten is present in the flour.various flours have more or less gluten present. all flour has some gluten (vital gluten). bread flour has considerably more gluten than, for example, all-purpose flour. flour with a more gluten is good for bread making, but should not be used for cake making.gluten (vital gluten) can be added to all-purpose flour to give it the amount of gluten already in bread flour. all-purpose flour with gluten added is often cheaper than bread flour. it is added to bread flour to give extra rise and consistency (which is why bakers use it). it is added at high altitudes to provide extra elasticity. the chemical reason has to do with reduced density at high elevations which causes the rising bread to fall if the dough lacks extra elasticity.gluten (vital
